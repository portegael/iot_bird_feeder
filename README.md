*<h1> IoT Bird Feeder :hatched_chick: </H1>*

This is the source code of the IoT Bird feeder based on Arduino MKR FOX 1200 for the contest organized by Hackster and Arduino.
I won the second prize with this prototype and I am currently working on the new features.
What will you find here, all the information I can provide, such as the system architecture, the hardware design, the arduino code and much more.
